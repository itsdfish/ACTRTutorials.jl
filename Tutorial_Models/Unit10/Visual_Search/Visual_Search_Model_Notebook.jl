# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will develop a model of fixation patterns during a conjunctive visual search task. The visual search model has some similarities to the memory-based models we developed so far. The model assumes that fixations are driven by the salience or activation values of objects in a visual array. Visual objects with a higher activation are more likely to be fixated. According to the model, visual activation consists of three components: topdown activation, which reflects the influence of goals, bottomup activation, which reflects perceptual contrast effects, and noise, which produces variation in fixation sequences for the same stimuli.  

## Task

We develop a model of the classic conjunctive search task. In a conjunctive search task, a person must search for a target with multiple attributes in an array of distractors. For example, a person might be instructed to find a red X among distractors that are red O's and blue X's. A common finding is that search times increase as a linear function of the number of distractors in the visual array. In addition, the slope of the linear function is greater when the target is absent compared to when the target is present. 


# Visual Search Model

The visual search model we will develop is based on work by Nyamsuren & Taatgen (2013)  and Moran et al. (2013). As previewed above, the fixations in the visual search model are driven by visual activation of objects in the visual field. In addition to visual activation, the model incorporates other mechanisms, such as differential acquity, inhabition of return, and a dynamic termination threshold. Each of these compoenents will be discussed in turn. 


## Iconic Memory

ACT-R's standard visual system assumes that all objects on the screen, collectively known as the visicon, are available to the visual system. We will denote the visicon as the set, $V$. Objects in the extra-foveal area have diminished visibility. As a visual object is moved away from the fovea, some features will no longer be visible. Thus, in actuality, only a subset of the visicon will be visible, depending on distance between the visual object from the point of fixation and the viewing distance of the model. The subset of visual objects that can be seen by the model is called iconic memory, which we denote as $IM \subset V$. Unless masked by a new stimulus, objects in iconic memory persist for a brief period of time after the physical stimulus is removed. 

## Differential Acuity

The visibility of objects and their features depend on the distance from the fovea. A feature, such as color, is visible if its angular distance in degrees from the visual fixation point is within an accuity threshold, forming a circle of visibility centered at the point of visual fixation. The accuity function is defined as

$\begin{align}
\tau = a_k e^2 - b_k e
\end{align}$

where $e$ is the eccentricity of the object, and parameters $a_k$ and $b_k$ are feature specific parameters. For example, color and shape have different accuity thresholds. Eccentricity is the angular size of the object in degrees:

$\begin{align}
e = 2\textrm{atan}(\textrm{width}/(2\textrm{vd}))
\end{align}$
 
where width is the width of the visual object in pixels (assumed to be approximately square), and vd is the viewing distance between the model and the object also in pixels. The size of the pixel depends on the screen resolution, which we assume to be 72 pixels per inch. 

A visual object is included in iconic memory if at least one feature is visible. A non-visible object can only be included in iconic memory if it was visible within the short persistence period (usually a few seconds or less). 

## Visual Activation

The model will attend to the visual object with the highest salience or visual activation. Visual activation is defined as

$\begin{equation}
\textrm{va}_i = w_{\textrm{td}} \cdot \textrm{td}_{i} + w_{\textrm{bu}} \cdot \textrm{bu}_{i} + \epsilon_i
\end{equation}$

td is topdown activation, bu is bottomup activation, $w_{\textrm{td}}$ is the weight for topdown activation, $w_{\textrm{bu}}$ is the weight for bottomup activation, $\epsilon \sim \textrm{normal}(0, \sigma)$ is normally distributed noise and $i$ indexes the $i^{\rm th}$ visual object.

### Topdown Activation

Topdown activation reflects the match between the features of a visual object $i$ and the visual target $t$. Given feature index set $K = \{1,2,\dots\}$ and feature value $v$, topdown activation is calculated as:

$\begin{equation}
\textrm{td}_{i} = \sum_{k \in K} \textrm{sim}(v_{i,k}, v_{t,k}) 
\end{equation}$

where sim a similarity function defined as:

$\textrm{sim}(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    1      & x = y\\
    0  & x \neq y \\
    .5 & \textrm{if x not visible}
  \end{cases}$

### Bottomup Activation

Bottomup activation represents perceptual contrast effects which causes a visual object that differs from surrounding visual objects to "pop out". The perceptual contrast effect decreases as contrasting visual objects are further away.  

$\begin{equation}
\textrm{bu}_{i} = \sum_{j \in IM} \sum_{k \in K}\frac{\textrm{dissim}(v_{j,k}, v_{i,k})}{\sqrt{d_{i,j}}}
\end{equation}$

where $d_{i,j}$ is the distance in pixels between visual object $i$ and $j$ and dissim is a dissimilarity function defined as: 

$\textrm{dissim}(x,y) =
  \begin{cases}
    0      & x = y\\
    1  & x \neq y \\
    0 & \textrm{if x not visible}
  \end{cases}$

### Illustration

In the following code blocks, we will demonstrate how bottomup activation works as a function of contrast and distance. First, we will load some dependencies.

## Inhabition of return 

The model includes a mechanism to limit fixating on a previously fixated visual object. The model maintains a list of the most recently attended visual objects called a finst. The size of the finst is determined by the parameter `n_finst`, which we set to 4. After a period of time specified by the parameter `finst_span = 3`, a visual object is removed from the list. If the finst is at capacity and a new visual object is added, the oldest visual object is removed so that the list never exceeds `n_finst`.  

### Dynamic Termination Threshold

The model uses a dynamic threshold for terminating visual search when the target cannot be found (Moran et al., 2013). The termination threshold $\tau$ is scaled in terms of activation and therefore competes with visual objects as a potential action. Each time the model fixates on a distractor, the termination threshold increases by $\Delta\tau$. Consequentially, the probability of terminating the search process increases after each failed attempt to locate the distractor. On the $n^{th}$ fixation, the termination threshold is 

$\begin{align}
\tau(n) = (n-1)\Delta\tau 
\end{align}$

## Illustration

The following code blocks provide an illustration of the visual search model. After loading the required packages, an experiment object is initialized, a visual array and visual target are generated, and the model performs a single visual search trial. Upon executing the block under "Perform Visual Search", a window displaying the visual array will appear:

- Blue represents low visual activation, whereas red represents high visual activation
- Unfilled black circle represents the model's visual attention
- Unfilled white circle represents the visual target

On each fixation, the model selects the visual object with the highest activation---that is, the visual object surrounded by the darkest red circle. The colors will change on each fixation due to noise in the activation values.

## Fixation Probability

The softmax function provides a convenient approximation for computing fixation probabilities. The probability of fixating on visual object $y_{t,f} \in \{1,2,\dots N_v\}$ where   

$\begin{align}
\textrm{Pr}(Y_{t,f} = y_{t,f} \mid w_{\textrm{td}})  \approx \frac{e^{\frac{\mu_i}{\lambda}}}{e^{\frac{\tau(t)}{\lambda}} + \sum_{j \in IM}e^{\frac{\mu_j}{\lambda}}}
\end{align}$

where $\tau(t)$ is the threshold parameter on fixation $t$,$N_v$ is the number of visual objects, and $\lambda = \sigma\sqrt{2}$.  

## Likelihood Function

Let $\mathbf{Y} = \{y_{1,1}, y_{1,2}, \dots, y_{T,F_t}\}$, be a vector of visual object indices where $t$ indexes the trial and $f$ indexes the fixation, $T$ is the number of trials and $F_t$ is the number of fixations on trial $t$.  The likelihood function is defined as

$\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}(\Theta \mid \mathbf{Y}) = \prod_{t=1}^T \prod_{f=1}^{F_t} \textrm{Pr}(Y_{t,f} = y_{t,f} \mid w_{\textrm{td}})

# Generate Data

Many functions are used to generate data from the visual search model. The full set of code can be found the fill `Visual_Search_Model.jl`, located in the current directory. Some functions called in `Visual_Search_Model.jl` can be found in the file package `VisualSearchACTR`. We will focus on three of the top level functions, which are annoted below. The function `simulate` is the generates data for a specified number of trials and parameters. It accepts the following arguments:

- n_trials: the number of simulated trials
- parms: variable keyword arguments for model parameters

`simulate` returns a data structure which contains the visual array and the target, and a vector of fixation objects, which contain information about the fixation time, the fixation object. 


The function `search!` implements search process: the model searches for the target until it is found or the termination threshold is met. On each fixation, the model updates the decay of visual objects of in iconic memory, the finst and recomputes the visual activations. When the search process has been completed, fixation data are added to the experiment object. `search` accepts the following arguments:

- actr: an actr model object
- ex: an experiment object containing information about the number of trials, fixation data, and stimulus properties

Finally, the function `_search!` is responsible for performing the search and attend processes, and accounting for the time of each process. `_search` accepts the same arguments as `search!`.

## Define Log Likelihood Function

The log likelihood is computed with three primary functions. Each annotated function can be found in the code block below. The basic approach is to reverse engineer the conditions under which the data were generated so that the fixation probabilities can be computed. 

The top level function `computeLL` computes the log likelihood across all trials of data. `computeLL` accepts the following arguments:

- stimuli: contains the target and visual array for all trials
- all_fixations: a vector of fixation vectors, where each sub-vector contains fixations of each trial
- topdown_weight: the topdown activation weight parameter

The function `loglikelihood_trial` computes the log likelihood across fixations of a given trial. The function begins by generating a new model object, and then computes the log likelihood of each fixation. After computing the fixation probability, model time is updated to the attend time, the visual object is modified in `attend_object!`, and the termination is incremented in `update_threshold!`. `loglikelihood_trial` accepts the arguments:


- ex: an experiment object containing information about the number of trials, fixation data, and stimulus properties
- target: visual target color and shape
- visicon: all visual objects in the visual array
- fixations: fixations for the current trial
- parms: variable keyword arguments for model parameters

The function `loglikelihood_fixation` computes the log likelihood of a given fixation. This involves updating the finist, activation values and other relevant quantitiates, and computing the fixation probability among visual objects that are currently visible to the model. `loglikelihood_fixation` accepts the following arguments:

- actr: an ACT-R model object
- visicon: all visual objects in the visual array
- fixation: the current fixation

## Define Model

The model and prior distributions are summarized as follows:

$\begin{align}
w_{\textrm{td}} \sim \textrm{normal}(0.66,.5)
\end{align}$

$\begin{align}
\theta_{t,f} = \Pr(Y_{t,f} = y_{t,f} \mid w_{\textrm{td}})
\end{align}$

$\begin{align}
y_{t,f} \sim \textrm{Bernoulli}(\theta_{t,f})
\end{align}$


In computer code, the model is specified as follows:
"""

# ╔═╡ a529d9bd-4c2f-4c7c-876d-92de641d0d1f
@model model(stimuli, all_fixations) = begin
    topdown_weight ~ Normal(.66, 0.5)
    all_fixations ~ VisualSearch(topdown_weight, stimuli)
end

## Estimate Parameters

Now that the priors, likelihood, and Turing model have been specified, we can now estimate the parameters. In the following code, we will run four MCMC chains with the NUTS sample for 2,000 iterations and omit the first 1,000 warmup samples.

## Results

A summary of the parameter estimates can be found in the output above. The diagnostic plots in the first and second panels for `topdown_weight` indicate that the chains converged and autocorrelation is low: the traces fluxuate randomly and are superimposed, and autocorrelation drops quickly. In the third panel, the posterior distribution encompasses the true value of 0.66, as expected. 

Compared to other models, parameter estimation for this model is longer. The reason parameter estimation takes longer is that the visual search model is computationally intensive: each trial has 10-15 fixations, and the activation values must be recomputed for each fixation due to differential accuity and inhabition of return. Bottomup activation in particular is computationally intensive. Bottomup activation is computed by comparing each visual object to the others, meaning computational complexity is $O(N^2)$. Activation values can be cached to improve speed if the properties of all visual objects are gaurenteed to be visible.
